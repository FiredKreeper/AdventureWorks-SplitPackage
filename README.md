Welcome to the AdventureWorks-SplitPackage repository! This repository contains an SSIS package that splits employee data from the AdventureWorksDW2017 database into country-specific tables, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and other countries. It showcases ETL processes using tools like Merge Join, Conditional Split, and OLE DB Destination for efficient data integration.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- **SSIS Package:** Contains the SSIS package file that demonstrates how to split employee data based on country.
- **Documentation:** Provides detailed information on the package, its functionalities, and how to run and customize it.
- **SQL Scripts:** Includes SQL scripts used in the package for data extraction and transformation.
- **Supporting Files:** Additional files that support the SSIS package functionality.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services):** Used for building and executing the ETL package.
- **SQL Server:** AdventureWorksDW2017 database is the source of employee data.
- **T-SQL:** Used for querying and transforming data within the SSIS package.
